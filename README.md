## About

I am an independent researcher and filmmaker working at the intersection of cinematic theory, perception, narrative systems, and emerging AI-driven creative frameworks. My work focuses on developing original theoretical models that redefine how cinematic reality, authorship, and creative intelligence are understood in the modern era.

My primary research contribution, **Zayne’s Theory of Cinematic Reality**, is a formally archived and DOI-registered theoretical framework intended as a foundational reference for future research, creative systems, and interdisciplinary study.
